# Titanic Survival Prediction - Decision Tree

This project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. The dataset used comes from the Titanic competition on Kaggle.

## Features
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
- **Age**: Passenger's age
- **Sex**: Passenger's gender (0 for male, 1 for female)
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard

## Goal
To build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the provided features.

## Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` (data manipulation)
  - `scikit-learn` (model building and evaluation)
  - `matplotlib` (visualization)
- **Data**: Titanic dataset from Kaggle
